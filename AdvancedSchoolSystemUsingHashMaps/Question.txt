Objective:
Develop a school system that can store detailed information about schools, students, subjects, and their marks using nested HashMaps.

Requirements:
School Details:

Each school should have a name and address etc.

Student Details:

Each student will have an ID, name, grade, and age etc

*Students should be grouped by school in the data structure.

Subject Details:

Each subject should include a name, teacher, and credit hours etc.

*Subjects will be stored under each student in the data structure.

Marks Details:

Each subject for each student will contain marks, grade (e.g., A, B, etc.), and optional comments etc.

*Marks data should be organized so that it can be easily retrieved and calculated.

Functionalities:
Add School:

Input a school name and address.

*Add this school as a key in the main HashMap.

Add Student:

Input details for a student, including their ID, name, grade, and age.

*Store this data within the specific school’s HashMap.

Add Subject and Marks:

For a specific student, input the subject name, teacher name, credit hours, marks, grade, and comments.

*Store these subject details under the student's entry.

Retrieve Marks for a Student in a Subject:

Input the school name, student ID, and subject name.

*Retrieve and display the subject’s marks, grade, and comments for the specified student.

Calculate Average Marks for a Student:

Input the school name and student ID.

*Calculate the average marks across all subjects for that student and display it.

Expected Outcome:
The system should effectively use nested HashMaps to handle complex data without needing custom classes, allowing for detailed tracking and calculation of information across schools, students, and subjects.

Make sure you store atleast 5 schools  with 5 students each.
